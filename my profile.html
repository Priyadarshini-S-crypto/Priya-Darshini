       <p>       My name is Priya Darshini, and I’m from Trichy, Tamil Nadu. I’ve recently completed my B.Tech in <i>Electronics and Communication Engineering</i> from <i>SASTRA Deemed to be University, Thanjavur</i>. I’m now waiting for my official graduation.
<br>     During my course, I developed a strong interest in software development. I’ve learned programming languages like <u>C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS and MySQL</u>. I’ve worked on several projects that helped me apply these skills. One of the most meaningful projects I’ve done is an <u>IoT-based women’s safety system</u> designed to help women and elderly people during emergencies by sending alerts and location details.
<br>     I’ve also created websites such as an <u>event management page and a perfume product page</u>, which are available online. These projects helped me understand the basics of web development and improved my hands-on skills.
<br>     I also completed a short internship at BSNL in Thanjavur, where I got to learn about networking, broadband, and telecom systems. It gave me a good understanding of how things work in the real world.
<br>     To build my knowledge further, I completed a <i>Java Developer certification</i> and attended a <i>Full Stack Development workshop</i>, which helped me understand both frontend and backend development.
<br>     I would describe myself as a <u>quick learner, team player</u> and someone who enjoys <u>solving problems</u>. Now that I’ve completed my degree, I’m looking forward to starting my professional journey in the software field, where I can apply my skills, grow continuously, and contribute meaningfully to a good team.
