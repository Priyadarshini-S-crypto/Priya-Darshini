      <h1>Priya Darshini's Intro</h1>
      <hr><p>My name is Priya Darshini, and I’m from Trichy, Tamil Nadu. I’ve recently completed my B.Tech in <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering from SASTRA Deemed to be University, Thanjavur</strong>. I’m now waiting for my official graduation.<br>

During my course, I developed a strong interest in software development. I’ve learned programming languages like <u>C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS and MySQL</u>. I’ve worked on several projects that helped me apply these skills. One of the most meaningful projects I’ve done is an IoT-based women’s safety system designed to help women and elderly people during emergencies by sending alerts and location details.<br>

I’ve also created websites such as an event management page and a perfume product page, which are available online. These projects helped me understand the basics of web development and improved my hands-on skills.<br>

I also completed a short internship at BSNL in Thanjavur, where I got to learn about networking, broadband, and telecom systems. It gave me a good understanding of how things work in the real world.<br>

To build my knowledge further, I completed a Java Developer certification and attended a Full Stack Development workshop, which helped me understand both frontend and backend development.<br>

I would describe myself as a quick learner, team player, and someone who enjoys solving problems. Now that I’ve completed my degree, I’m looking forward to starting my professional journey in the software field, where I can apply my skills, grow continuously, and contribute meaningfully to a good team.<br>
